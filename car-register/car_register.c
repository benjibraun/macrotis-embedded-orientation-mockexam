/* Write a car register!
 * You should store the following data in a structure, called "car":
 *  - the manufacturer's name (which is shorter than 256 characters)
 *  - the price of the car (in euros, stored as a floating point number)
 *  - the year of manufacture
 *  - the type of the transmission (as a custom type, see below)
 *
 * You should store the transmission type in an enumeration ("transmission"),
 * the valid types are:
 *  - manual
 *  - automatic
 *  - CVT
 *  - semi-automatic
 *  - dual-clutch
 *
 * The "car"-s are stored in an array.
 *
 * Write the following functions:
 *  - get_older_cars_than(struct car* array, int array_length, int age)
 *      - it returns the count of the older cars than "age"
 *  - get_transmission_count(struct car* array, int array_length, enum transmission trnsm)
 *      - it returns the count of cars which has "trnsm" transmission
 */

 /* Create a personal ID registers
 * You should store the following data in a structure, called "person":
 * - the name of the person (which is shorter than 256 characters)
 * - the year of the birth (1990)
 * - the type of the highest qualification (as a custom type, see below)
 *
 * You should store the qualification type in an enumeration ("qualification"),
 * the valid types are:
 *  - elementary-school
 *  - high-school
 *  - bsc-degree
 *  - master-degree
 *  - phd
 *
 * The "person" -s are stored in an array.
 *
 * Implement the following functions:
 * - get_oldest_alive()
 *    - it should return the age of the oldest person
 * - get_qualification_count()
 *    - it returns the count of persons which has "quali" qualification
 * For both functions you have to add the needed parameters!
 * You don't need to implement a function, which initializes the persons, just do it manually from main(). E.g. initialize your persons in main() with 4 elements in order to be able to test your 2 implemented functions if it works correctly.
