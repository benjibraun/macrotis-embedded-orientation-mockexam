# Macrotis Embedded Orientation Exam

## Getting Started

 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

## What can I use?

- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Commit often**, but *Don't push your work* to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up!
  - **Why?** We have seen some bad results being copied by others this way in the past with previous cohorts. Just because someone is fast doesn't mean they are right too. We want to see what You can do.

## Important notes

- Read the whole specification before you start to write the code. Check whether You fully understand it.
  - If not, ask one of the mentors!
- Take a bit of time to slow down and think it over. Plan for a minute what You will do.
- If You feel You are stuck, stop and:
  - Do some other part of the exam and return here in short while.
  - Review Your own code. Read it to Yourself as if You'd read it to someone who doesn't know coding. This usually helps discover logical mistakes we all make sometimes.
  - Just look out the window, notice details around You, take some deep breaths, calm Yourself.
- Ask for mentor help if something isn't clear!
- If Your IDE (Eclipse or Codeblocks) doesn't work:
  - Again slow Yourself and check one by one everything.
  - Make Clean and rebuild the project
  - Empty the workspace an reload the projects
  - Restart the IDE
  - If all fails ask a mentor - we want to measure Your coding skills not how well You can wrestle with a fancy text processor.
- Hint for the STM32 based task:
  - Write the program in a template that we previously used in any of the workshops, or download the .rar skeleton.
  - Copy manually the source file or files that you are modified to the exam repo and commit
